# Wildlife-Tracker
This application was developed to allow Rangers to track wildlife sightings in the area.
# Description
Application for the Forest Service to track animals during an environmental impact study.

Project which I am provided with the code containing the basic classes, Spark setup, VelocityTemplateEngine, vtl template structure, routing in App.java, tests, and database setup instructions, which I am to test, correct errors, and complete the requirements for.

The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clearcut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir. Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study. This application was developed to allow Rangers to track wildlife sightings in the area.
